I am currently a post doctoral researcher in the lab of [Claus O. Wilke](https://wilkelab.org/) at The University of Texas at Austin. 

Previously, I completed my PhD at Northwestern University where I was joinly advised in the labs of [Luis A.N. Amaral](https://amaral.northwestern.edu/) and [Michael C. Jewett](http://jewettlab.northwestern.edu/). 

My research interests span a range of topics in computational and theoretical biology.
