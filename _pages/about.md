Welcome to my personal website. I am currently a post doctoral researcher in the lab of [Claus O. Wilke](https://wilkelab.org/) at The University of Texas at Austin. My research interests span a range of topics in computational and theoretical biology. As the current state would hopefully make obvious, **this website is very much a work in progress**.



###### Credit where credit is due
<span style="font-size:0.75em;">*This website was built using the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and is hosted on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com). This template was originally forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then graciously extended by [Stuart Geiger](stuartgeiger.com). Overall, the process of getting set up and modifying the template is fairly straight-forward to set-up, and I'd be happy to help if you have any questions about where to begin.* </span>
