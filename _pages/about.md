I am currently a post doctoral researcher in the lab of [Claus O. Wilke](https://wilkelab.org/){:target="_blank"} at The University of Texas at Austin. 
Previously, I completed my PhD at Northwestern University where I was joinly advised in the labs of [Luis A.N. Amaral](https://amaral.northwestern.edu/){:target="_blank"} and [Michael C. Jewett](http://jewettlab.northwestern.edu/){:target="_blank"}. 
My research interests span a range of topics in computational and theoretical biology.

<span style="font-size:0.75em;">*This website was built using the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io){:target="_blank"} and is hosted on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com){:target="_blank"}. This template was originally forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/){:target="_blank"} created by Michael Rose, and then graciously extended by [Stuart Geiger](stuartgeiger.com){:target="_blank"}. For my small part, I added a landing/splash page to the basic layout. Overall, the process of getting set up and modifying the template to make a nice and clean website is fairly straight-forward, and I'd be happy to help if you have any questions about where to begin. All source code for the site is available on [my GitHub page](https://github.com/adamhockenberry/adamhockenberry.github.io){:target="_blank"}* </span>
