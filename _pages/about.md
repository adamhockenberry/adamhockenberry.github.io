Welcome to my personal website. I am currently a post doctoral researcher in the lab of [Claus O. Wilke](https://wilkelab.org/) at The University of Texas at Austin. My research interests span a range of topics in computational and theoretical biology. Currently, as the current state would hopefully make obvious, this website is very much a work in progress.

It's worth noting that if you're reading this, you should beware that **this website is very much a work in progress** and most links/content have yet to be edited.

This website was built using the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and is hosted on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com). This template was originally forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then graciously extended by [Stuart Geiger](stuartgeiger.com) to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. If anything in that description sounds intimidating, I promise that it's not too difficult to get started and set yourself up with a page. You may have seen many folks with similar looking personal webpages and there's a very good reason for that: this process and the template are fairly simple to set-up, and I'd be happy to help if you have any questions about where to begin.
