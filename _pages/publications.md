Since I'm still working on the site, I'd ideally like to add in a listing of my papers with all of the relevant PDFs to share. But for now, you can find a fairly up-to-date listing of my articles on [my Google Scholar page.](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=W5qqC2wAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate){:target="_blank"}
