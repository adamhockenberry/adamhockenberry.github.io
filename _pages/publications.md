Since I'm still working on the site, I'd ideally like to add in a listing of my papers with all of the relevant PDFs to share. But for now, you can find a fairly up-to-date listing of my articles on  <u><a href="{{author.googlescholar}}">my Google Scholar page</a>.</u>

#{% include base_path %}

#{% for post in site.publications reversed %}
#  {% include archive-single.html %}
#{% endfor %}
