  - excerpt: 'Welcome to the personal webpage of Adam John Hockenberry! I'm a generally trained data scientist, but have focused much of my academic career on challenges in big-data biology. Below I hightlight some specific areas of research, but feel free to check out my publications for more details (and reach out if you have any questions!)'

    title: "Protein structure and translation"
    excerpt: 'Beginning with my graduate school work, and continuing on through my post-doctoral studies I have focused on characterizing the language of microbial genomes. In particular, my research has looked at how codon usage biases (akin to synonyms in spoken language) and usage of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence (a form of punctuation mark that often defines the beginning of genes) vary within and between the genomes of bacteria and viruses. Perhaps most importantly, my work has looked at what these features can tell us about the life-history of individual species and how they can be leveraged to engineer genomes for synthetic biology applications.'

#    title: "Cellular growth"
#    excerpt: 'Bacteria come in all shapes and sizes, and different species have dramatically different capacities for growth. Under the most idealized conditions that researchers have yet been able to imagine, some species are capable of doubling their population over time-scales spanning days and weeks. By contrast, other species are capable of rapid growth with population doubling times in as little as 10 minutes. My work is currently surveying the overall landscape of this growth rate variation and looking for how this important feature of growth capacity is encoded within the genomes of individual species, and conversely how growth variation imposes selection on those genomes.'

#    title: "Biological data science"
#    excerpt: 'One of the most exciting aspects of being a data scientist working in biology is trying to discern how phylogenetic structure inhibits our ability to make statistical inference, and ideally how to overcome this obstacle. Two siblings are more closely related to one-another than any two random humans, two humans are more closely related to one-another than either is to chimpanzees, and a human and a chimp are much more closely related to one-another than either is to a sea anemone. This lack of independence in data points presents tremendous obstacles to statistical inference, as nearly all off-the-shelf statistical models make the iid assumption (independent and identically distributed). Further, sampling of individuals and species is far-from uniform. We know the genome sequence of more sars-cov-2 viruses than all other viruses combined. Working through these challenges and developing statistical tests and frameworks to account for this feature is an active and on-going area of my research, particularly as it pertains to machine and deep learning models.'

#    title: "The importance of why"
#    excerpt: 'While my research has taken a variety of different directions over my career, the common thread that unites this disparate topics is a drive to uncover *why?*. Data by itself can only tell part of a story, but contextualizing that data within what is currently known and speculating what might come next are critical to scientific advancement. Further, putting these thoughts into general and accessible language for the public to be able to easily digest is critical for encouraging diverse voices to carry on the torch to the next set of interesting questions.'
