I was a founder, co-creator, and co-instructor for what would eventually become a 7 day boot-camp (and later a full-length course) for incoming graduate students at Northwestern University. Drawing on programs from across the university, we taught the fundamentals of `Python` programming with a focus on data science and statistics. I helped to design and contribute materials and served as an instructor for the course for several iterations spanning from 2015-2017.
