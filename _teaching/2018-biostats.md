I taught a semester-long course in [Biostatistics](https://stat.utexas.edu/undergraduate/courses-undergraduate#biostats) to approximately 90 undergraduate students. Responsibilities included developing and refining course materials, managing 1 graduate TA and 3 undergraduate TAs, and lecturing 3 semester-hours per-week.
